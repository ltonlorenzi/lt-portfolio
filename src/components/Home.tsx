          Hi there! I'm a passionate React developer with a love for creating
          interactive and engaging web applications. My journey in web
          development started during my studies, and I've been hooked ever
          since. I enjoy bringing designs to life using the latest web
          technologies. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new tech
          trends and trying out different coding challenges.
